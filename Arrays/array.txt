int[][] k = Arrays.copy(p); // ❌ This will not work!
Let me tell it to you straight:
Arrays.copy(...) doesn’t exist. You probably meant Arrays.copyOf(...), but even that won’t deep copy a 2D array!

✅ Correct Way to Deep Copy a 2D Array in Java:

int[][] k = new int[p.length][];
for (int i = 0; i < p.length; i++) {
    k[i] = Arrays.copyOf(p[i], p[i].length);
}
This creates a deep copy, meaning:

You get a new outer array

Each inner array is a copy, not just a reference to the original

⚠ Why not just Arrays.copyOf(p, p.length)?
java
Copy
Edit
int[][] k = Arrays.copyOf(p, p.length); // ❗ Only shallow copy
This only copies the references to the inner arrays. Changing k[i][j] will still affect p[i][j] 😱

🔥 Want to copy a 2D array of objects like String[][] or Integer[][]?
Same logic applies — just use a loop and Arrays.copyOf().
